# SudokuSolver

Just Another Sudoku Solver

## Description

Basically it's a SudokuSolver class, there's no GUI, everything is pushed to standard output. Sudoku tables are read from text files (examples in tables\ directory), solve method tries to solve it. First - it tries to solve as much as it can using 'smart' methods (I'm not a Sudoku master, so forgive me if names of those methods are completely different than used in Sudoku world :)), and if they fail - brute force algorithm is used. This project was created mostly for fun, I've tried to imitate solving methods I usually use for medium difficulty sudoku tables + brute force (as recursive method) to solve even the thoughest ones.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.x (tested on 3.9)


### Executing program

* You'll find some basic usage (instance creation & basic method use) in main.py - you can just adjust the table name and launch it.
